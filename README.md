**Important!**
- If your bug report is not related to the core code (such as a 3rd party module or your server configuration) then the issue will be closed without a reason. You must contact the extension developer, use the forum or find a commercial partner to resolve a 3rd party code issue.
- If you would like to report a serious security bug please PM an OpenCart moderator/administrator on the forum. Please do not report concept/ideas/unproven security flaws - all security reports are taken seriously but you must include the EXACT details steps to reproduce it. Please DO NOT post security flaws in a public location.


## Versioning

The version is broken down into 4 points e.g 1.2.3.4 We use MAJOR.MINOR.FEATURE.PATCH to describe the version numbers.

A MAJOR is very rare, it would only be considered if the source was effectively re-written or a clean break was desired for other reasons. This increment would likely break most 3rd party modules.

A MINOR is when there are significant changes that affect core structures. This increment would likely break some 3rd party modules.

A FEATURE version is when new extensions or features are added (such as a payment gateway, shipping module etc). Updating a feature version is at a low risk of breaking 3rd party modules.

A PATCH version is when a fix is added, it should be considered safe to update patch versions e.g 1.2.3.4 to 1.2.3.5
